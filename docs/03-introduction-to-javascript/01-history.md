# History of Javascript

Javascript was created over 25 years ago as a way to add scripting to the Netscape web browser. Prior to this there was no way to add scripted behaviour to an HTML webpage. The first version of Javscript was created by Brendan Eich over a period of 10 days in 1995. It has since become a standard feature of all web browsers.

The language was first known as Mocha, then Livescript, and finally Javascript. The final name was a marketing ploy, as Java had recently been released by Sun Microsystems.

The standardized version of the Javascript language is known as [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), which is why you'll sometimes hear people refer to particular version of the language as ES#, where # might be a version number or a year, like ES6 or ES2020.
