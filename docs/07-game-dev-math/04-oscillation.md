## Module Topics

- Angles (Radians vs Degrees)
- Angular Motion
- Trigonometry (sohcahtoa)
- Drawing Vectors Using Trig
- Polar vs Cartesian Coordinates
- Simple Harmonic Motion
- Waves
- Pendulum Motion
- Spring Forces

## Objectives:

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Differentiate between radians and degrees for the measurement of angles.
- Use trigonometric functions to determine the missing lengths / angles of a right angle triangle.
- Differentiate between polar and cartesian coordinates.
- Use sin and cos to convert between polar and cartesian coordinates.
- Draw waves of varying complexity using sin within a p5js sketch.
- Combine knowledge of angular momentum with trigonometry to model pendulums in p5js.
- Add Hookeâ€™s law to model systems of springs.
