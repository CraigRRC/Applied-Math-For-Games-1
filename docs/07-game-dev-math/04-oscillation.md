# Oscillation and Trigonometry
{: .no_toc }

Trigonometry is the mathematics of right-angle triangles.

We can use trig to simulate waves, swinging motions, and springs.

## Objectives:

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Differentiate between radians and degrees for the measurement of angles.
- Use trigonometric functions to determine the missing lengths / angles of a right angle triangle.
- Differentiate between polar and cartesian coordinates.
- Use sin and cos to convert between polar and cartesian coordinates.
- Draw waves of varying complexity using sin within a p5js sketch.
- Combine knowledge of angular momentum with trigonometry to model pendulums in p5js.
- Add Hooke’s law to model systems of springs.

## Angles (Degrees)

Rotation is measured using an **angle**. A counter-clockwise rotation will range from 0 to 360 degrees.

![Rotations Measured Using Degrees - Source: Our Textbook](degrees.png)

A quarter rotation is 90 degrees, and is said to be a **right angle**. A half rotation is 180 degrees and a full rotation is 360 degrees.

We use the ° symbol to indicate that a value is measure in degrees. Example: A right angle is 90°.
