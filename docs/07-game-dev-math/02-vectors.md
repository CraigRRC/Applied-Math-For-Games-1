## Module Topics

- Scalars vs Vectors
- Vector Addition
- Vector Subtraction
- Vector Multiplication
- Vector Magnitude
- Normalizing Vectors
- Velocity and Acceleration as Vectors

## Objectives:

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Define a vector and differentiate it from a scalar value.
- Describe how a vector can be used to define both a point in a 2D space and a magnitude with direction.
- Calculate the result of 2D vector addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Calculate the length/magnitude of a given 2D vector.
- Calculate the normalized unit vector from a given 2D vector.
- Use vectors to model simple linear acceleration and velocity in a p5js application.
