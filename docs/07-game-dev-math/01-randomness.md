## Module Topics

- Mean and Standard Deviation
- Probabilities and Distributions
- Pseudo-Random Numbers
- Random Walks

## Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Explain what is meant by mean and standard deviation and how to calculate these values from a dataset.
- Describe how to calculate the probability of a single uniform event (coin toss, card selection).
- Differentiate between uniform and Gaussian probability distributions.
- Use p5js to generate uniform, gaussian, and Perlin random numbers.
- Use p5js to simulate and graph the probability distributions of uniform and Gaussian events.
- Implement a random walk simulation using p5js.
