## What's Next? Staying Up To Date with Javascript

The Javascript language is standardized and improved by way of [the ECMAScript specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

Starting with ECMASCript 6 (ES6 in 2015) a new version of the specification has been published yearly.

Additions to the language don't end up in the browsers immediately, but we can check [caniuse.com](https://www.caniuse.com) to see when new features are widely supported.

Along with improvements to the language syntax there are also new [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) being added to the browser.

A great way to keep up with the Javascript language is to listen to web development podcasts like [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) and [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/), or subscribe to email roundups like [Javascript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/) and [Frontend Focus](https://frontendfoc.us/).
