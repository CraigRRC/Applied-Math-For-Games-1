# Numbers

Numbers are the basis for all of mathematics. In this module, we'll explore how mathematicians group different types of numbers into separate categories. We'll review how numbers are represented in different numeral systems. And lastly, we investigate how whole and real numbers are represented and stored by computers.

## Objectives

- Define the various categories of numbers used by mathematicians.
- Define decimal, binary, hexadecimal numeral systems.
- Convert between these numeral systems.
- Count using the binary and hexadecimal systems.
- Explain how computers represent real numbers.
- Convert real numbers to the binary IEEE 754 format.
