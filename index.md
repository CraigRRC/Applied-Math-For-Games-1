# Applied Mathematics for Games 1

This course covers the foundational mathematics required for video game development. Learners will solve common game development problems by applying mathematical and logical solutions. Numeral systems, trigonometry, probability, precision, and the basics of 2D vectors and geometry will also be covered.

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Compare, contrast, and convert between common numeral systems.
- Distinguish between types of numbers and how they are represented in computer languages.
- Use the language of study to:
  - Create programs that make use of 2D graphics, images, text, sound and user input.
  - Demonstrate the use of pseudo-randomness and algorithmic noise in graphical applications.
  - Solve 2D vector problems involving addition, subtraction, normalization, and magnitude.
  - Use vector mathematics to simulate forces, acceleration, and motion on a 2D plane.
  - Employ trigonometry to solve basic rotation, distance, and oscillation problems.
