# Applied Mathematics for Games 1 

This course covers the foundational mathematics required for video game development. Learners will solve common game development problems by applying mathematical and logical solutions. Numeral systems, trigonometry, probability, precision, and the basics of 2D vectors and geometry will also be covered. 

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to: 

* Compare, contrast and convert between common numeral systems. 
* Distinguish between types of numbers and how they are represented in computer languages. 
* Employ trigonometry to solve basic rotation and distance problems. 
* Use vector mathematics to simulate forces, acceleration, and motion on a 2D plane. 
* Analyze and trigger events occurring in systems and games using statistics.
