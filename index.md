# Applied Mathematics for Games 1

## Applied Math for Games 1 Description

This course covers the foundational mathematics required for video game development. Learners will solve common game development problems by applying mathematical and logical solutions. Numeral systems, probability, precision, and the basics of 2D vectors and geometry will also be covered.

## Applied Math for Game 1 Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Compare, contrast, and convert between common numeral systems.
- Distinguish between types of numbers and how they are represented in computer languages.
- Use the language of study to:
  - Create programs that make use of 2D graphics, images, text, sound and user input.
  - Demonstrate the use of pseudo-randomness and algorithmic noise in graphical applications.
  - Solve 2D vector problems involving addition, subtraction, normalization, and magnitude.
  - Use vector mathematics to simulate forces, acceleration, and motion on a 2D plane.

# Applied Mathematics for Games 2

## Applied Math for Games 2 Description

This is the second of three courses covering the mathematics required for video game development. This course covers the essential geometric and algebraic tools and techniques used in game development and graphics programming. Other common game-related mathematical topics will be
explored.

## Applied Math for Game 2 Course Outcomes

By the end of this course using the language of study, students should be able to:

- Employ trigonometry to solve basic rotation, distance, and oscillation problems.
- Perform scaling, rotation, and translation in 2D and 3D contexts.
- Implement vector-based particle systems in a 2D or 3D context.
- Implement game mechanics using vectors, oscillation, and a 2D physics library.
- Create a portfolio of game math examples / demos using p5.js.
